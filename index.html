<p>We first merge the peak area data with the dilution and sample annotation. Next, we created a nested <code>dilution_data</code> for each transition name.</p>
<p><code>dilution_data</code> will be used later to do dilution curve related analysis for each transition.</p>

<p>The R package <a href="https://github.com/lifs-tools/rgoslin">rgoslin</a> is useful in getting additional information of lipid names such as the lipid classes. A column called <code>For_Rgoslin</code> was created to convert each transition name that can be parsed by <a href="https://github.com/lifs-tools/rgoslin">rgoslin</a>. Unfortunately only <a href="https://www.lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMPR02010001?LMID=LMPR02010001">Coenzyme Q10</a> is unable to be parsed by <a href="https://github.com/lifs-tools/rgoslin">rgoslin</a>. We thus add the relevant information manually.</p>
<p>Below is an code example (not part of the pipeline) on how <a href="https://github.com/lifs-tools/rgoslin">rgoslin</a> can be used</p>

<p>The second step is to create a raincloud plot (QC Sample Type (without RQC) vs Injection Sequence) for each transition. A new column called <code>no_rqc_data</code> is created from <code>sample_data</code> to filter out the RQC samples. The filtered samples are then used to create the plot. A new column <code>raincloud_panel</code> is created to contain such a plot.</p>

<h1>Cognostics</h1>
<p>To output these interactive plots as a trellis plot in html, we need to convert our current tibble and <code>dilution_plot_table</code> and <code>injection_sequence_table</code> into a cognostics dataframe.</p>
<p>The cognostics dataframe consist of three components</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A group of columns known as conditioning variables. They will form the unique id of the trellis plot. As such, each row of these columns must be unique. In our example, the column used is <code>Transition_Name</code></li>
<li>One column that holds the images to display each plot in the trellis. This column is known as the panel variable. We just created this column using <code>trelliscopejs::pmap_plot</code> earlier.</li>
<li>The other columns will be grouped as general cognostics columns.</li>
</ol>

<p>The function <a href="https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/reference/cog.html"><code>trelliscopejs::cog</code></a> is used to convert a column into cognostic object. The following meta information must be provided in order for the conversion to be successful.</p>
<p>Given a column name, we need to provide</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of the column name (meta information)</li>
<li>The type of cognostics to used. For our example only “numeric” and “factor” are used. Other factor types can be found in the documentation of <a href="https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/reference/cog.html"><code>trelliscopejs::cog</code></a></li>
