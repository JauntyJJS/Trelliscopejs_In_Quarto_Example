# Quarto Report Example With Plotly and Trelliscopejs

Here is a report showing how to create injection sequence plot and dilution plot using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) for each transition.

## Injection Sequence Plot

![Injection Sequence Plot](images/Injection_Sequence.JPG){fig-alt="An injection sequence plot."}

## Dilution Plot

These multiple interactive plots will be displayed as a trellis using [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/).

Refer to the [NEWS.md file](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/Trelliscopejs_In_Quarto_Example/blob/main/NEWS.md) to see what is being worked on as well as update to changes between back to back versions.
