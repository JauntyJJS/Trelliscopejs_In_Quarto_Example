# Quarto Report Example With Plotly and Trelliscopejs

Here is a report showing how to create injection sequence plot and dilution plot using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) for each transition.

## Injection Sequence Plot

![Injection Sequence Plot](images/Injection_Sequence.JPG){fig-alt="An injection sequence plot."}

## Dilution Plot

![Dilution Plot](images/Dilution_Plot.JPG){fig-alt="A dilution plot."}

These multiple interactive plots will be displayed as a trellis using [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/).
