# Quarto Report Example With Plotly and Trelliscopejs

Here is a report showing how to create injection sequence plot and
dilution plot using [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) for each
transition. These multiple interactive plots will be displayed as a
trellis using [`trelliscopejs`](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/).

Refer to the [NEWS.md
file](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/Trelliscopejs_In_Quarto_Example/blob/main/NEWS.md)
to see what is being worked on as well as update to changes between back
to back versions.
